## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Unfortunately I struggled with the image sizing on this one and still didn't quite achieve the full design. However, I got to revisit an old JS code that I had previously used with help from friends that had made accordion codes and further pick it apart to develop my understanding of beginner Javascript for the future. I had a lot of fun combining flexbox and grid to make this piece come to life.

### Continued development

Begin to learn Java, for certain. It's becoming unavoidable.

Figure out how to do the images without them being cut off or disappearing entirely while putting them into the code.
